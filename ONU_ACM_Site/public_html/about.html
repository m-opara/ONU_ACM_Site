                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>We are the Local Association of Computing Machinery at Ohio Northern University (ACM@ONU). Our goal is to be the local organization for individuals who want to apply their passion for technology and do amazing things. The reason that we are an organization is to allow like minded individuals to have a place to meet others like themselves and provide an opportunity to showcase the ability of a group of people with a common goal. Our aim is to be able to teach our members concepts that they can use not only now but also in the various work environments that they might find themselves in after their academic carriers.We also know the value of unwinding and having fun, so we strive to create events that are what are members want to attend and are looking forward to.</p>
                <p>ACM according to their national organization website says that “ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking.</p>
                <p>Founded at the dawn of the computer age, ACM’s reach extends to every part of the globe, with more than half of its nearly 100,000 members residing outside the U.S.  Its growing membership has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering networking opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and technical communities.  Their actions enhance ACM’s ability to raise awareness of computing’s important technical, educational, and social issues around the world.” (<a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization">acm.org - “About ACM”)</a></p>
                <p>With every action that we take in our local chapter we strive to operate by the goals and principles of the national organization, making sure to put the member first in all decisions. We achieve a balance of the national organizations standards and our goals with the help of our members to ultimately make ACM@ONU the great organization that it is.</p>
