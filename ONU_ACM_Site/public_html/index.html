                <h3>The Mission</h3>
                <p>The Local Association of Computing Machinery at Ohio Northern University (ACM@ONU) is the organization for those with a passion for all things Tech! The organization's goal is to have a place for like minded students to gather together to learn about various forms of technology, through workshops, guest speaker events, local challenges, competitions, and more. We not only attend events like this but also host events like this, and we welcome all to join, Comp Sci or otherwise. While we do encourage ACM organization membership we do not require it for the majority of our activities.</p>

                <h3>Are you in the Member Archive?</h3>
                <p>In an effort to create a digital member archive of ACM@ONU members we’ve created a small database section to store the names, photos, and descriptions of past and present members, which will someday act as an alumni yearbook. If you are interested in leaving your mark on ACM@ONU history, then add yourself to the archive section of the site.</p>
